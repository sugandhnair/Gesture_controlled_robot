# gesture_controlled_robot
Hand gesture based robot using ADXL355 accelerometer and  two TI MSP430 MCU's one for the receiver side and the other for the transmitter side with NRP module as the transceiver.

Library files for the NRF module - https://github.com/spirilis/Enrf24.git

For test purposes if you intend to use the serial montior on the Energia IDE make sure to short the RX and TX pins of the MSP430 microcontroller.

Calibration values of the accelerometer may vary based on the module.
